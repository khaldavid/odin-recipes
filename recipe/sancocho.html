                        <p><h2>Steps to prapare the greatest Sancocho ever</h2></p>
                        <li>Peel and cut the yuca, yautia, green plantain and yellow plantain into 1-inch pieces. Scrape out the seeds, then chop the calabaza,
                            skin on, into 1-inch pieces. Put each ingredient in a separate bowl, adding water to cover vegetables in order to prevent them from 
                            turning brown while you prepare the rest of the soup.</li>
                        <li>Husk the corn, then slice it into 2-inch-thick segments. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Season pork (or beef) and chicken with 1/2 tablespoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
                        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot over medium-high. Add the pork and brown on all sides for 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer 
                            to a clean, large bowl, then add the chicken to the same pot, and brown on both sides for another 5 minutes, adding oil as needed if the pot gets dry.
                            Transfer with a slotted spoon to the same bowl as the pork.</li>
                        <li>Reduce heat to medium and add sofrito to the pot, scraping up any browned bits of meat and incorporating them into the mix. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes,
                            until liquid has evaporated and mixture darkens in color.</li>
                        <li>Return the pork, chicken and any accumulated juices to the pot. Add the stock, bay leaves and remaining 1 tablespoon salt, and bring to a boil over
                            high heat. Once simmering, reduce heat to medium-low and cook uncovered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                        <li>To keep the vegetables from falling apart, add each one in order of firmness, cooking each for 5 minutes before adding the next. Begin with the yuca,
                             then yautia, green plantain, yellow plantain, calabaza and corn, cooking the yuca for a total of 30 minutes and the corn for only 5 minutes.</li>   
                        <li>Add chorizo and stir well to incorporate. Cook for another 10 to 15 minutes over medium-low heat until meat and vegetables are tender and break easily
                            with a fork. Because of all the starches and meat in this dish, this stew tends to be thick and rich. Some of the vegetables will fall apart, giving it
                            a porridge consistency. This is a good thing.</li>  
                        <li>Adjust salt to taste, and serve with fresh bread or white rice on the side.</li>
